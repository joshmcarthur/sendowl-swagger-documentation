This repository contains [Swagger](https://swagger.io) documentation for the [SendOwl API](https://sendowl.com/developers). It has been created by hand from the existing API documentation, in the hope that future API changes will be reasonably minor to update here.

The motivation for creating this documentation is to allow Swagger-codegen to generate API clients for the SendOwl API in a large range of languages. For Rabid, the generation of a Rubygem to talk to SendOwl is particularly useful!
